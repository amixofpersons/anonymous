anonymous
=========

Weekend project for Phase 3: an anonymous message board for people to post secrets.

Notes for the group that's taking over:
======================================

Summary of the idea: 

Users can post without revealing their identity, when you comment on a post you only have an image to represent your identity. You can edit comments but you can't edit posts. Posts disappear after a certain amount of time, and they are ranked by either popularity and/or time; you can also upvote posts or comments, but not downvote them. We have already done a lot of the styling discussions, and we even have wireframes to e-mail you guys.

Stuff that's left to do:

A lot of the backend is done, but the forms are missing. You just have to link up the forms with the controllers - the new post and new comment forms aren't there yet, and the voting buttons are missing. Make it look pretty?

Also, the temp file was acting up, contact one of us if it starts happening again.

Cheers,
Dakota's Angels.
